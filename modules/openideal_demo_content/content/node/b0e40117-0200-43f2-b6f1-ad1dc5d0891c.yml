      value: "<p>COVID-19 has fundamentally changed our ways of working in the UN. We have had to adapt to working remotely, postpone or cancel duty travel, learn how to move events to virtual platforms, and much more. The pandemic presents unexpected challenges, but also numerous opportunities for collaboration, innovation, learning and transforming the UN together. When the dust settles, what has this difficult time taught us that we want to hold on to?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the UN to&nbsp;Reimagine the UN Together&nbsp;towards a more inclusive, agile and participatory organisation that is resilient to crises going forward, the collective creativity and energy of as many UN system colleagues as possible will be needed to co-create the change needed. Thatâ€™s what the&nbsp;Reimagine the UN Together&nbsp;Challenge is all about. It's a place to collectively imagine the Next UN, building on lessons learned during the COVID-19 crisis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is the&nbsp;Reimagine the UN Together&nbsp;Challenge?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;Reimagine the UN Together&nbsp;is a UN system-wide ideation and crowdsourcing challenge to unleash the creativity, experience and skills of colleagues from across the UN to share, innovate and scale solutions to common business challenges we are experiencing in the COVID-19 crisis and to contribute toward building a more resilient, agile UN.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The focus areas for the&nbsp;Reimagine the UN Together&nbsp;Challenge were identified through a UN-wide Pulse Check, in which more than 4,600 colleagues from across the UN system shared challenges and highlighted opportunity areas.</p>\r\n"
